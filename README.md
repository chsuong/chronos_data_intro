# chronos_data_intro

I have looked at some metadata for documents in the database 'declassification_cables' in a very rudimentary fashion. I'm in the process of expanding and looking at other databases as well.

I created a html/rmarkdown file to explore the databases and to make Word-compatible tables. I will migrate to Python for analyzing the text.
